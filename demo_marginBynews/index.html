   <h2 class="during-coro">I. During the coronavirus pandemic</h2>
   <p>In “Dependence on Tech Caused ‘Staggering’ Education Inequality, U.N. Agency Says,” Natasha Singer writes:</p>
   <blockquote>
   <p>During the coronavirus pandemic, many schools moved classes online. Was your school one of them? If so, what was it like to attend school online? Did you enjoy it? Did it work for you?</p>
   <p>In early 2020, as the coronavirus spread, schools around the world abruptly halted in-person education. To many governments and parents, moving classes online seemed the obvious stopgap solution.</p>
   <p>In the United States, school districts scrambled to secure digital devices for students. Almost overnight, videoconferencing software like Zoom became the main platform teachers used to deliver real-time instruction to students at home.</p>
   </blockquote>
   <h2 class="student-conten">II. As a student, what advice would you give to schools that are already</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>What findings from the report, if any, surprised you? If you participated in online learning during the pandemic, what in the report reflected your experience? If the researchers had asked you about what remote learning was like for you, what would you have told them?</li>
        <li>At this point, most schools have returned to in-person teaching, but many still use technology in the classroom. How much tech is involved in your day-to-day education? Does this method of learning work well for you? If you had a say, would you want to spend more or less time online while in school?</li>
        <li>What are some of the biggest benefits you have seen from technology when it comes to your education? What are some of the biggest drawbacks?</li>
    </ul>
